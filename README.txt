Step 1: Create a reverse proxy using Nginx

We will start by creating a reverse proxy using Nginx. Nginx will forward the incoming requests to the API gateway.

Step 2: Create an API gateway using Django

Next, we will create an API gateway using Django. The API gateway will route the incoming requests to the appropriate microservices based on the request URL.

Step 3: Define Service model for microservices

We will define a Service model for microservices in the Django application. This model will store information about the microservices, including their base URL and API key.

Step 4: Create a view to register microservices

We will create a view to allow microservices to register with the API gateway. This view will accept the base URL and name of the microservice and generate an API key for it. It will then store this information in the Service model.

Step 5: Create a view to request access and refresh tokens

We will create a view to allow clients to request access and refresh tokens. Clients will need to provide their username and password to obtain the tokens. The access token will have a maximum lifetime of 5 minutes, and the refresh token will have a maximum lifetime of 30 seconds.

Step 6: Create a decorator to protect microservices

We will create a decorator to protect the microservices. This decorator will verify the access token and API key for each request to ensure that the client has permission to access the microservice.

Step 7: Logging

Finally, we will add logging to the API gateway. We will log each incoming request and its response to help with debugging and monitoring.

We can then use the following use-case example to illustrate how this workflow would work for a single microservice:

The microservice would register with the API gateway by sending a POST request to the registration endpoint. This request would include the microservice's base URL and name.

The API gateway would generate an API key for the microservice and store it in the Service model.

A client would authenticate with the API gateway by sending a POST request to the authentication endpoint. This request would include the client's username and password.

The API gateway would validate the client's credentials and issue an access token and refresh token.

The client would use the access token to make requests to the microservice. Each request would include the access token and the microservice's API key.

The API gateway would verify the access token and API key for each request using the decorator.

The microservice would receive the request and respond to it.

The API gateway would log the request and response for monitoring purposes.

After 5 minutes, the access token would expire, and the client would need to request a new one using the refresh token.

Overall, this workflow provides a secure and scalable way to manage access to multiple microservices through a centralized API gateway.
